## Scalable Distributed Training of GPT-2 and BERT using a Custom MPI-Based FSDP Framework

This project explored advanced techniques for designing and optimizing systems that run large-scale AI models efficiently. We focused particularly on transformer-based architectures like BERT, implementing various performance optimization strategies across the full stack.

---

## Project Overview

As AI models grow increasingly complex, the systems supporting them must evolve to meet demanding computational requirements. This project addressed this challenge through a comprehensive analysis and implementation of optimization techniques at multiple levels:

1. **Hardware-level optimizations** - Leveraging specialized accelerators and memory hierarchies
2. **Software-level optimizations** - Implementing efficient algorithms and data structures
3. **Model-level optimizations** - Applying techniques like quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation

The goal was to demonstrate significant performance improvements while maintaining model accuracy.

## Key Implementations

### Quantization Techniques

We implemented various quantization methods to reduce computational requirements:

```python
def quantize_weights(weights, bits=8):
    # Calculate scale factor to fit range into target bits
    scale = (2**(bits-1) - 1) / max(abs(weights.max()), abs(weights.min()))
    
    # Quantize weights
    quantized = np.round(weights * scale).astype(np.int8)
    
    return quantized, scale
```

### Memory-Efficient Attention

Implemented an optimized attention mechanism that reduces memory footprint:

```python
def memory_efficient_attention(query, key, value, mask=None):
    # Calculate attention scores in smaller chunks
    batch_size, seq_len = query.shape[0], query.shape[1]
    chunk_size = min(128, seq_len)
    
    outputs = []
    for i in range(0, seq_len, chunk_size):
        chunk_q = query[:, i:i+chunk_size]
        scores = torch.matmul(chunk_q, key.transpose(-1, -2)) / math.sqrt(chunk_q.size(-1))
        
        if mask is not None:
            chunk_mask = mask[:, i:i+chunk_size]
            scores = scores.masked_fill(chunk_mask == 0, -1e9)
        
        attn_probs = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
        chunk_output = torch.matmul(attn_probs, value)
        outputs.append(chunk_output)
    
    return torch.cat(outputs, dim=1)
```

### Distributed Training Optimization

Our distributed training approach focused on minimizing communication overhead:

```python
def gradient_compression(gradients, compression_ratio=0.1):
    # Determine threshold for top-k values
    k = max(1, int(gradients.numel() * compression_ratio))
    values, indices = torch.topk(gradients.abs().flatten(), k)
    threshold = values.min()
    
    # Create mask for values above threshold
    mask = gradients.abs() >= threshold
    
    # Sparse representation
    compressed = torch.zeros_like(gradients)
    compressed[mask] = gradients[mask]
    
    return compressed
```
