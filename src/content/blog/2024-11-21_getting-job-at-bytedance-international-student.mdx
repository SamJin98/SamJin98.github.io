When I first started grad school in the U.S., one of my biggest worries wasn't the classes or projects — it was the job search. As an international student on an F-1 visa, I knew the clock was ticking. CPT, OPT, H-1B… all of it was intimidating.

But a year later, I signed an offer with ByteDance to join as a full-time software engineer. Here's how I got there — and what I learned along the way.

----------

### Phase 1: Building a Strong Base

I came to Case Western with a decent CS foundation, but I knew I needed to stand out.

-   I picked up research work in AI and backend systems.
    
-   I built and deployed real full-stack apps — not just toy projects.
    
-   I documented everything: GitHub, personal blog, even demos.
    

----------

### Phase 2: Internships and Experience

Summer internships were crucial. I landed a research assistant role where I helped scale a generative AI system. That project gave me practical experience with API design, LLM tuning, and infrastructure — all things that mattered in interviews.

I also freelanced and contributed to open-source projects. Anything that proved I could build and ship.

### Phase 3: The ByteDance Process

ByteDance's process was rigorous:

1.  **OA (Online Assessment):** A mix of algo questions and system design cases.
    
2.  **Tech Interviews:** Heavy on backend knowledge, concurrency, and infra.
    
3.  **Behavioral Rounds:** Focused on ownership, autonomy, and team dynamics.
    

What helped most:

-   Prepping with LeetCode and real infra diagrams
    
-   Reframing academic projects into impact-driven stories
    
-   Practicing answers with friends — especially around system ownership

### Phase 4: Visa & Logistics

After the offer, I worked with their immigration team to align start dates and CPT/OPT timelines. Pro tip: get everything in writing and keep your international student office in the loop.

### Reflections

If you're an international student aiming for tech jobs in the U.S., here's my biggest takeaway:

**Start early. Build real things. Talk about impact.**

Don't get lost in the fear of “what if.” Focus on the work, the learning, and the people who can support you.

ByteDance was one of many places I applied to — but it stood out because of the teams, the scale, and the mission. I'm excited for what comes next.
