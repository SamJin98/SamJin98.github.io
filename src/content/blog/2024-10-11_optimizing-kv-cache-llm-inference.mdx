During my graduate research at Case Western, I became obsessed with a very specific problem: why are large language models so memory-hungry at inference time?

Specifically, I focused on the **KV cache** — the key-value pairs stored during decoding in transformer-based models. These caches are critical for fast autoregressive generation, but in multi-layer models, they balloon quickly and dominate memory use.

What started as curiosity turned into a full-blown optimization project.

### The Problem: KV Cache Bloat

When using a transformer decoder to generate text, each new token adds key-value pairs at every layer. If you're generating long sequences, the memory footprint can spike drastically, especially when you use multiple decoding paths (like in speculative decoding).

I wanted to answer:
- Can we reduce the KV cache size without hurting output quality?
- How do we balance accuracy vs. speed in speculative decoding setups?

---

### My Approach

1. **Token Importance Ranking**
   I experimented with using **attention scores** to rank previously generated tokens. Tokens that had little influence on the current output could be pruned from the cache.

2. **Layer-wise Pruning**
   Different layers contribute differently to output generation. I added logic to prune KV pairs in higher layers more aggressively — this provided a memory-speed tradeoff.

3. **Speculative KV Reuse**
   In speculative decoding (draft and target model), I worked on aligning KV caches so that reusable tokens wouldn’t have to be recomputed if verified.

---

### What Worked

- **Selective Retention**: Dropping low-attention tokens gave 20–30% memory savings on longer sequences with minimal loss in quality.
- **Hybrid Cache Policy**: Combining fixed-length retention with dynamic filtering performed better than either alone.
- **Compatibility**: The optimizations worked without needing to retrain the model — important for working with off-the-shelf LLMs.

---

### Challenges

- **Attention scores aren't perfect** — sometimes seemingly unimportant tokens became useful again later.
- **Multi-turn contexts** made retention harder. I had to build a more nuanced pruning logic to avoid chopping off parts of the conversation that were later relevant.
- **Debugging was brutal** — memory errors across 12 layers with custom pruning code was not for the faint of heart.

---

### Takeaways

This project taught me a lot about real-world LLM inference:

- **Inference speed matters** as much as model accuracy, especially in production.
- **You can’t optimize blindly** — you need ways to quantify the impact of changes, both on metrics and on final outputs.
- **There’s always more fat to trim**, but the best gains come from understanding the system, not just tweaking knobs.

I plan to open source a simplified version of the cache optimization framework soon. If you're working on inference infra or LLM tooling, hit me up — I'd love to collaborate!
