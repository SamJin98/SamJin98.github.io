title: 'The March Where Everything Was a Draft'
date: '2024-03-19'
excerpt: 'I lived in a loop of drafts—code drafts, email drafts, thesis drafts, unreadable thoughts on paper. And none of them shipped.'
tags: ['Reflection']

There was a month when I couldn’t finish anything.

Every idea started as a bullet point. Every bullet point turned into an outline. Every outline became a draft. Then it stopped.

Google Docs were filled with broken syntax. Emails remained in “unsent” limbo. Even my research progress reports had TODOs inside TODOs.

And yet, I wasn’t slacking — I was *thinking too hard*.

### What Happened?

I thought perfection was the goal.
I revised before I shipped. I redesigned before I deployed. I self-critiqued before anyone else had a chance.

But perfection doesn’t ship. Drafts don’t execute. And ideas trapped in my head didn’t help my project deadlines.

### What I Learned

- Shipping something broken is better than hoarding something perfect in silence.
- Review is a privilege earned through release.
- Not all drafts need to become deliverables — but some absolutely must.

### What Changed After March

I gave myself a rule: publish one thing a week, even if it’s ugly.
Code, reflection, meme, doesn't matter. Just something.

It didn’t solve everything, but it stopped the spiral. My confidence returned — not because I got better, but because I got visible.
