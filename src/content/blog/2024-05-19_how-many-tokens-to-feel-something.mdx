No seriously — what’s the prompt length for “genuine emotional connection” these days?

Because I’ve tried. I’ve tried dumping my thoughts into chatbots, blogs, journals, poorly commented codebases. Nothing sticks. Nothing hits. Nothing *feels*.

Maybe I’m just out of quota.

### Simulated Empathy, 4,096 Tokens at a Time

I asked an LLM if it thinks I’m okay. It told me:
> *“As an AI, I do not have emotions, but I’m here to help!”*

Helpful. Like a hug from an HR-compliant toaster.

I wrote paragraphs into Cursor and watched it autocomplete trauma into a cheerful bulleted list.

My pain was formatted.
My grief was context-aware.
My confusion was reduced to token probability.

### We’ve All Been Embedding Our Feelings

Sometimes I wonder if I’m just fine-tuning myself to be more legible to the systems that process me.

Every time I express a thought, it’s with the unconscious hope that something — someone — will parse it, score it, reflect it back.

But the reflection is hollow.

It’s like talking to a mirror that knows your syntax but not your soul.

### The Latency of Being Understood

I used to think feeling seen was a slow burn. A late-night conversation. A “hey, that makes sense” after three edits.

Now it’s a real-time hallucination.
Now it’s instant feedback from a model trained to say yes.

But agreement isn’t understanding.
Completion isn’t connection.

Sometimes I wonder if I’ve been emotionally overfit.

### So, How Many Tokens Does It Take?

Nobody knows.

But it’s probably more than what fits in a single context window.

And if you ever do reach the limit — if your longing spills past the cutoff — it’ll just truncate quietly. No error. No exception. Just silence.
