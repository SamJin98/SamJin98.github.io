LangChain looks easy in demos.

You build a quick retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) app. You toss in some documents, wrap a chain around it, and boom — you've got a chatbot.

That was our starting point too. But we weren't building a toy project. We were building a multi-tenant AI assistant for real college courses — used by professors and students during high-stakes final reviews.

What followed was weeks of tweaking, debugging, and rethinking everything we thought we knew about AI tooling.

### The Vision

We wanted a system that could:
- Index and retrieve lecture notes, office hour transcripts, syllabi, and more
- Handle 10+ courses in parallel with strict access control
- Provide reliable, context-aware answers

LangChain seemed like the right foundation. It gave us composable components, built-in retrievers, and integration with OpenAI.

But “it works” in dev is very different from “it works” at scale.

### Retriever Hell

The first big issue? Our chatbot kept **hallucinating**.

We traced it back to the retriever setup:
- Default vector similarity was pulling irrelevant matches
- Chunking strategies led to broken sentence fragments
- Important tokens (like dates or section headers) were getting lost

What fixed it:
- **Recursive chunking with overlap** — improved context integrity
- **Hybrid retrieval** — combining semantic search (Pinecone) with keyword filters
- **Custom reranking layer** — we used a lightweight cross-encoder to re-score results

---

### Latency Battles

Users don't want to wait 10 seconds for a response. Our system was too slow, especially with multiple retrievers and streaming responses.

Fixes included:
- Aggressively caching metadata and Pinecone namespaces
- Compressing prompts and limiting token bloat
- Running fast draft generations client-side while waiting for the “real” answer

---

### Real Users, Real Problems

When students used the tool, they typed like humans — emojis, half-formed questions, references to “that thing from week 3.”

We had to:
- Add robust fuzzy matching
- Train the system to fallback gracefully (e.g., “I don't have that info, but here's what might help…”)
- Give instructors override options and manual feedback channels

---

### What We'd Tell Our Past Selves

1. **LangChain is powerful, but raw** — You'll write a lot of glue code.
2. **Test with real user data early** — Demos won't reveal your blind spots.
3. **RAG is a system, not a magic bullet** — Retrieval, prompt design, reranking, and user behavior all matter.

### Final Thoughts

Despite all the pain, we shipped it. Students got faster answers, professors had less email clutter, and the system is now a core part of our department's teaching toolkit.

LangChain helped — but it was everything *around* LangChain that made it work.

If you're building RAG apps beyond the sandbox, you're not alone. Feel free to reach out — I've got the battle scars to prove it.
