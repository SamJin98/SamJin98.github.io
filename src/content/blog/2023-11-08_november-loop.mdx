Wake up. Coffee. Class. Lab. Debug. Slack. Sleep. Repeat.

That was November. A loop. An infinite loop.

Every week was the same. It felt like nothing was moving — like I was frozen in some eternal “in-progress” state.

But one quiet week, I noticed something: the bugs weren't as scary. The deadlines felt more manageable. I could explain things to other people without spiraling.

### The Progress You Don't See

Growth doesn't feel like growth in the moment. It feels like stagnation. Like tedium. But buried under repetition is familiarity. And buried under familiarity is mastery.

I realized I wasn't stuck. I was just… loading.

### A Small Shift

One week, I shipped a tiny internal feature that saved our team 10 minutes per deploy. No one noticed. No celebration.

But that moment reminded me: the loop isn't failure. It's **training**.

### The Loop Isn't the Enemy

If you're in one now, don't panic. Keep looping.
Because one day you'll wake up, rerun your week — and realize you've upgraded.
