title: 'Grad School Isn't Forever, But Google Docs Are'

excerpt: 'A reflection on the digital footprints, scattered thoughts, and growth you can track just by opening last year's folders.'

I opened a random folder in my Google Drive last week. It was named something like `AI_Paper_Notes_Fall23_v2`.

Inside? A mess. Half-written abstracts. TODO lists. Tables of results with no context. Prompt engineering drafts for a chatbot that didn't quite work. Lecture notes from a class I barely remember attending.

But buried in that mess was something unexpected — progress.

### A Timeline You Didn't Mean to Write

I never set out to chronicle my grad school experience. But the timestamps don't lie:
- April 2023: trying to figure out how to fine-tune a model.
- August 2023: planning infrastructure for the AI teaching tool.
- November 2023: first draft of the resume that got me the ByteDance interview.

You can trace the whole arc. Not through social media. Through Google Docs.

### More Than Just Notes

Some docs were pure chaos — but they captured real thoughts in motion:
- Frustration when a system wouldn't deploy.
- Half-baked theories for a research paper.
- Ideas I was too tired to pitch in class, but wrote down anyway.

They weren't polished. But they were *real*. Honest snapshots of how I thought, struggled, and learned.

### The Quiet Wins

There are also wins I forgot to celebrate:
- That clean CI/CD diagram I ended up reusing in interviews.
- A debugging checklist that saved me twice.
- Feedback from my advisor that I skimmed then, but now appreciate.

The kind of stuff you ignore when it happens, but thank yourself for later.

### What I'm Taking With Me

Grad school ends. The files stay.

I'll probably export a few, archive the rest. But more than anything, I'm grateful for that paper trail. It's imperfect, chaotic, and sometimes embarrassing — but it tells the real story.

If you're in school (or even just building something), keep the notes. Keep the drafts. One day, you'll open a folder and realize how far you've come.

**And maybe, just maybe — future-you will say thanks.**
