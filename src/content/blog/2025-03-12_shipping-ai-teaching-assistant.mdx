This time last year, I was deep in research meetings, trying to answer one deceptively simple question: how can we help students learn better with the help of AI?

The idea started as a collaborative research project at Case Western Reserve University. We weren't just building a chatbot for professors — we were building an intelligent system that could support student learning by organizing, surfacing, and helping answer academic questions across multiple courses. Our goal wasn't automation for its own sake — it was to create **a scalable educational assistant** that improved clarity, access, and engagement for every student.

### What We Set Out to Solve

In every course, there are always unanswered questions — and students don't always know where to ask them, how to find prior answers, or how to articulate them clearly. Professors, meanwhile, are overloaded. We asked:

- What if students could get help *faster* — with AI surfacing the most relevant content from past questions and course materials?
- What if we made question answering collaborative, transparent, and reusable?
- What if the system itself could scaffold learning, rather than just automating replies?

Our AI assistant was designed to do just that.

### Building the Stack

We started small:

| Layer       | Stack                                                     |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js for the web, SwiftUI for iOS                     |
| **Backend**  | FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and a Pinecone vector store        |
| **Auth**     | University SSO using JWT + role-based access control    |
| **LangChain**| Multi-hop retrievers, summarizers, prompt pipelines     |
| **CI/CD**    | Vercel + GitHub Actions for fast iteration               |

One technical breakthrough was the **Retrieve Merger** — a retrieval layer that pulled answers from multiple indexed sources (lecture notes, transcripts, syllabus) and re-ranked them based on student context.

We also built namespace-aware indexing in Pinecone to support multi-tenant deployments across courses and institutions.

### Teaching With AI: More Than Just Answers

The assistant wasn't meant to replace instructors — it was meant to **amplify** them.

- Students could **ask natural language questions** and receive summarized, contextual answers based on approved sources.
- The system promoted **retrieval over memorization**, encouraging students to learn how to ask better questions.
- Professors used it to **triage and guide class discussions**, surfacing common themes and confusion areas.
- The feedback loop between **AI insights and instructional strategy** helped educators adjust materials on the fly.

### Lessons from Production

1. **Start simple** — Our earliest version didn't generate answers. It just organized and indexed questions. But that alone created real value.
2. **Students teach the system** — The way students phrase questions shaped how we built retrievers and prompt logic. Their input made the system smarter.
3. **AI is a partner, not a proxy** — Our best results came when teachers stayed involved, using the assistant to extend—not replace—their presence.

### What I'm Proud Of

This wasn't just an experiment — it became part of students' daily academic lives. We helped make knowledge more accessible, learning more self-driven, and classrooms more responsive.

It's still evolving, but this project taught me how AI can support **real, human-centered education** — not through automation, but through augmentation.

And if even one student found an answer that helped them keep going, that makes it all worth it.
