excerpt: 'A sudden moment of clarity, a cracked window, and the realization that solving hard problems in the wrong direction wasn't enough.'

I remember the moment clearly. The logs were green. My code had deployed. The infra was holding up. From a technical perspective, everything was working perfectly.

And yet — I felt absolutely nothing.

I sat there, watching the dashboard update like it meant something. But deep down, I wasn't building anything I cared about. I was solving complex problems for goals I didn't believe in.

Then came the thought that cracked everything open:

> *“I'm optimizing throughput for something I don't believe in.”*

That was it. That was the thought. It didn't scream or shout. It just settled into my bones like gravity. And I knew I couldn't keep going.

### The Exit Wasn't Dramatic

I didn't storm out. I didn't rage-quit. I just started writing again — writing proposals, sketching out research questions, thinking about what I wanted to teach, not just build.

I started choosing curiosity over velocity. Purpose over optimization. I started sitting with questions again. 

One of them was: *What if I could help students think, not just debug?*

It wasn't about abandoning software. It was about reclaiming the **why**.

### Why Academia?

Because academia still rewards asking the *right* questions, not just fast answers. Because students remind you that learning is a sacred process. Because research lets you stretch — not just scale.

Because I missed the feeling of pursuing a question not for quarterly KPIs, but for truth. Even temporary, imperfect truth.

Because in the classroom, ambiguity isn't a bug — it's the point.

I wasn't looking for an easier life. I was looking for a more honest one.

### What I Found Since

- **Peace in complexity** — not because I solved it, but because I could sit with it.
- **People who care** — about teaching, about inquiry, about slow thinking.
- **Projects that breathe** — not everything has to be a sprint to demo day.
- **Moments of meaning** — when a student's question surprises you, or your own assumptions collapse mid-research.

I learned that the impact I wanted didn't require more velocity. It required space. For thought. For failure. For ideas that weren't obviously monetizable.

And maybe most of all: I found meaning in the unfinished.

I didn't leave tech. I just left the version of it that made me forget *why* I started.

And in July 2023, that was enough to change everything.

It wasn't burnout. It was awakening. Not collapse — **realignment**.
