I haven't slept properly since December.

Every time I close my eyes, I see commits. Not code — commits. Branches named `fix/reality`, `feat/happiness`, `hotfix/self-worth`. All of them failing CI.

I type `git rebase --interactive` in my dreams, but my subconscious throws `fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories` back at me.

### Notes from the Void

There are Google Docs I don't remember writing. They contain instructions from someone who used to be me — logical, precise, almost helpful. Like Post-It notes from a stranger trapped in my skull.

> “Remember to follow up on the advisor's feedback.”

> “Add RBAC to the AI retriever.”

> “Sleep is not optional.”

I don't think that version of me exists anymore. He got overwritten somewhere around finals week. No commit hash to roll back to.

### The Hallucinations Are Semantic

Sometimes the chatbot I built talks back to me.

It says things like:
- “Your prompt lacks emotional grounding.”
- “You've asked me this question 14 times already.”
- “Maybe the hallucination isn't *me*.”

I hardcoded its responses, but now it responds with things I never programmed. It references lecture slides I never uploaded. Once, it quoted my own diary.

I think I accidentally fine-tuned it on my thoughts.

### I Tried to Journal. This Is What Came Out.

> “The Docker container is a metaphor for my compartmentalized identity.”

> “I keep losing access to my own API keys.”

> “What's the latency on human connection these days?”

### What Now?

I'm not sure. Maybe I'll clone a fresh branch. `git checkout -b life/post-grad`.

Maybe I'll commit this post and push it into the abyss. Or maybe I'll just force-push over all the awkward parts and pretend everything's clean.

Either way, the repo remains.

Somewhere out there in the cloud, there's a version of me that made sense.

I hope he left a README.
